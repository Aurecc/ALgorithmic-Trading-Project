# Algorithmic Trading Project with Python

In this GitHub repository, I present an Algorithmic Trading Project with Python where we can apply 3 different strategies to the S&P 500 index. Each strategy is showcased in a Jupyter Notebook and the output of the code is an Excel File with the symbols, stock prices, relevant columns, and the target number of shares to buy for each symbol in the strategy.

## Strategies

### 1. Equal-Weighted S&P 500 Portfolio
This strategy involves creating a portfolio where each stock in the S&P 500 index is equally weighted.

### 2. Momentum Strategy
The momentum strategy involves analyzing the S&P 500 index and selecting stocks that have shown upward momentum in their stock prices.

### 3. Value Investing Strategy
The value investing strategy involves identifying undervalued stocks within the S&P 500 index based on certain fundamental metrics.

## Output
The code will prompt the user for the portfolio size or the amount of money to invest, and it will output the Excel file containing the symbols, stock prices, relevant columns, and the target number of shares to buy for each symbol in the strategy.

## Data Source
This project requires an API key from IEX Cloud (https://iexcloud.io/) in order to access the data. The free trial for the API key lasts for 7 days.

## References
My main reference for this project comes from a video tutorial, which can be found at: [Algorithmic Trading Using Python - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfzGZB4HhEE&t=13637s). However, I have written a slightly different code as the video is 4 years old and some things have changed. I have also written other functions and lines differently in order to make it more my style.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository to understand and implement these algorithmic trading strategies using Python.
